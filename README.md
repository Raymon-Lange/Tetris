Certainly! Here's an updated version of the README file that includes instructions for installing `pygame-ce`:

```
# Tetris

This is a Tetris game implemented in Python.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download it from the official Python website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Raymon-Lange/Tetris.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```

   **Note:** If you encounter any issues with the installation, make sure you have the latest version of `pip` installed by running `pip install --upgrade pip`.

## Build and Run

Once you have completed the installation steps, you can build and run the Tetris game.

1. Execute the following command to start the game:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

   This will launch the game in your terminal.

2. Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the movement of the tetrominoes. The goal is to clear as many lines as possible by filling them completely with blocks. The game ends when the blocks reach the top of the screen.

3. Enjoy playing Tetris!
